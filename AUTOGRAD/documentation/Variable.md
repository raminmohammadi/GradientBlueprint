# Understanding Computational Graphs with the Variable Class

In the realm of machine learning and deep learning, understanding the fundamental concepts behind automatic differentiation and computational graphs is crucial. The `Variable` class presented here offers a simplified yet insightful exploration into these concepts. This document aims to elucidate the `Variable` class and its associated functionalities.

## 1. Introduction to the Variable Class

The `Variable` class is a foundational component for constructing computational graphs. It represents a variable within a computational graph, encapsulating both a numerical value and information about its relationships with other variables through mathematical operations.

## 2. Constructor

The `__init__` method initializes a `Variable` object with the following parameters:

- **data**: The numerical value of the variable.
- **_children**: A set to track the variables contributing to the current variable.
- **_op**: A string representing the mathematical operation associated with the variable.
- **label**: A label for the variable, aiding in graph visualization.

## 3. Mathematical Operations

### 3.1. Arithmetic Operations

#### `__add__`

The `__add__` method overloads the addition operator `+`. It computes the sum of two variables and tracks the operation for gradient computation.

Example:

```python

a = Variable(2)
b = Variable(3)
c = a + b
print(c.data)  # Output: 5

# Gradient computation:
# dc/da = 1, dc/db = 1

```



#### `__sub__` 

The `__sub__` method overloads the subtraction operator -. It allows one Variable object to be subtracted from another, producing a new Variable object with the difference of their values. Like `__add__`, it also tracks the operation for gradient computation during backward propagation.

Example:

```python
a = Variable(5)
b = Variable(3)
c = a - b
print(c.data)  # Output: 2

# Gradient computation:
# dc/da = 1, dc/db = -1

```

#### `__mul__` 

The `__mul__` method overloads the multiplication operator *. It allows two Variable objects to be multiplied together, producing a new Variable object with the product of their values. Similar to `__add__` and `__sub__`, it tracks the operation for gradient computation during backward propagation.

Example:

```python
a = Variable(2)
b = Variable(3)
c = a * b
print(c.data)  # Output: 6
# Gradient computation:
# dc/da = 3, dc/db = 2
```


#### `__pow__` 


The `__pow__` method overloads the exponentiation operator **. It raises a Variable object to the power of another Variable or constant, producing a new Variable object with the result. Like other mathematical operations, it also tracks the operation for gradient computation during backward propagation.


Example:

```python
a = Variable(2)
b = a ** 3
print(b.data)  # Output: 8

# Gradient computation:
# db/da = 3 * (2 ** (3 - 1)) = 12

```

### 3.2. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (exp)

The exp method calculates the exponential function of a variable.

Example:

```python
a = Variable(2)
b = a.exp()
print(b.data)  # Output: 7.38905609893065

# Gradient computation:
# db/da = e^a = e^2
```

4. Automatic Differentiation

4.1. Backward Propagation
The backward method enables automatic differentiation by performing backward propagation through the computational graph. It calculates gradients with respect to the input variables using the chain rule.

5. Visualization
5.1. Graph Visualization
The `__draw__` method generates a visual representation of the computational graph using the draw_dot function. This visualization aids in understanding the structure of the graph and the flow of computations.

6. Special Methods
The Variable class also implements special methods to support reverse operations (`__radd__`, `__rsub__`, `__rmul__`, `__rtruediv__`) and negation (__neg__).

7. Examples
To illustrate the usage of the Variable class, let's consider some examples.

8. Conclusion
The Variable class serves as a foundational tool for understanding computational graphs and automatic differentiation. By exploring its functionalities and examples, learners can gain insight into these core concepts, laying a solid foundation for further study in machine learning and deep learning.
